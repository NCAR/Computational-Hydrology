The CMIP3 ensemble, released in 2011, was based on 112 climate projections downscaled across the contiguous U.S. using the Bias-Correction and Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD) technique. These downscaled climate projections were then translated into hydrologic projections over only the Western U.S.. The CMIP5 ensemble was based on 234 CMIP5 climate projections downscaled using BCSD and then translated into hydrology using methods similar to the CMIP3 ensemble but with several method updates and expansion to include the full contiguous U.S..  Although there was 231 BCSD5 climate projections, hydrologic modeling practicalities limited the scope to a subset of 97 BCSD5 climate projections representing 31 CMIP5 climate models and 4 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.
